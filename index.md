## Boulder Dash

You race through dangerous tunnels avoiding boulders and rocks. YOu ride in an old mining cart. You will be able to tild the cart from left to right to avoid and obstacles. The goal is to collect as many coins as you can before getting to the end of the ride. Also you will have two lives to complete the tunnel ride.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kharris1211/mycis277finalapp/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
